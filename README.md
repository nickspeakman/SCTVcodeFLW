# SCTVcode
SCTV scope clock code
The SCTV Scope Clock from Cathode Corner displays time, words and games on a 3 inch oscilloscope tube, using a Teensy 3.6 computer to generate X-Y-Z signals. 
This code makes it run. 

This code is based on Cathode Corner's v1.0.2 code with a series of added clocks, including two FLW (Four Letter Word) clocks. One based on "pure swearing" and the other on ~2,500 four leter words and their definitions. I think later versions of Cathode Corner's code allow for newer arduinos so a merge may be needed for newer clocks.

A demonstration can be seen in the video below
